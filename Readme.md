# Overview

This is a simple soundboard soundboard app that allows the user to make beats with simulated drumpads. 

I wanted to create an app that looked better than the ones currently on the market, and I think I have succeeded to a degree!

# Development Environment

This code was written in Xcode using SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a relatively new declarative language that reminds me of CSS for those interested in web development. It allows you to create iuser interfaces entirely programmatically. For help on learning SwiftUI, I highly recommend looking into "Hackingwithswift" by the amazing Paul Hudson along with "CodewithChris" for great video-based tutorials.

In this app I leveraged Swift5 and Foundation along with AVFoundation.

# Future Work

Things to improve:
* Allow audio to keep playing in some cases so that the user can play over other audio (this would require new calls to AVFoundation
* Allow the user to loop audio like a loop pedal
* Create more screens and allow the user to put in their own sounds (a truly great experience)
*Improve the basic UI to my Figma design
